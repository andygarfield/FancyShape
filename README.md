# FancyShape
This project has in mind users who, like me, do not have access to the more expensive versions of ArcGIS. The idea is to create reverse-engineered duplicates of the vector Geoprocessing tools and to put them in a Python toolbox. The tools are categorized as they would be in ArcToolbox, so finding the tool you need should be straight-forward.

# Installation
Extract the repository into any folder

Right-click in ArcToolbox > Add Toolbox... > Navigate to and add the Python toolbox
